Salesforce Stuff I've Written to Make Things Work
All the stuff here has been redacted for confidentiality. 
Anything that you'll need to update with info specific to your environment
will be noted.

The Unique Years count is something that NPSP cannot do out of the box but should be able to as it's a pretty
straight-forward SQL query. 

This is one possible solution to that problem. 
I'll post updates as my knowledge of the platform increases.
Feel free to use anything you like but it is provided with no warranty and no guarantees.
Seriously, use at your own discretion!
