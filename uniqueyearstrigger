 * @Description        : Counting the number of years (or streak) a donor has given over a period of time is not built into Salesforce                            and its actually really difficult to achieve - conceptually and with SOQL Limit errors. This project was to                              calculate the number of years a donor has given over a period of time. In this case, 20.

 Notes on the environment: 
 - You will need to create two opportunity contact role fields. One will be CloseDate and the other will be Fiscal_Year.
 - CloseDate: Formula field - that looks up the close date of the related opportunity. 
 - Fiscal Year: Formula, Text field that calculates off the above CloseDate = TEXT(YEAR(DATEVALUE(CloseDate__c)))
 - There are a number of reasons I chose to put this on the Opportunity Contact Role Object, rather than the Opportunity/Contact/Account. 
 Known issue : when deleting an opportunity, it doesn't force an update.
